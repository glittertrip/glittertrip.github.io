<h1 align="center">Hi! Welcome to my web page~</h1>
<p align="center">My name is Alex, and I'm a 16 year-old girl living in Chicago. I like art, music, and coding!</p>

<h3>A Little Bit About Me-</h3>
<img src="https://resources.depaul.edu/deblogs/Tim-Littman/PublishingImages/fall4.jpg" align="right" width="185" height="270">
<p align="left">I grew up in Garfield Ridge, a neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. When I was little I was an only child, so I often had to entertain myself. This actually led to my interest in coding. Whenever I got bored, I would often try to learn new things like spoken languages and HTML. Other than coding, I also really liked watching crime documentaries and Cartoon Network. To this day, I love cartoons and animation of all types; from Disney to anime, I'll watch it all!</p>
<p>Despite how awesome I am, I have never really been very popular. A lot of my peers in grade school thought I was really loud and opinionated. My interest in anime, comics, and rock music had made me an outcast, so I didn't have very many friends until high school. This wasn't entirely a bad thing, though. It just made me value my friends way more.</p>
